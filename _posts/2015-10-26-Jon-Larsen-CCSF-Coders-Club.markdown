The City College San Francisco [Coders Club](http://hills.ccsf.edu/~coders/templates/index.php) has their students create videos, 
called "lightning talks" explaining different concepts in Computer Science and Software Development.

My friend [Jon Larsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsenjon) has created a couple of them and they're quite good. 

My favorite is [Creating Text with Markov Chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCbdErw4bZk) 
it's a good intro to stochastic models for a non math audience.
