A [Quite Interesting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06q53rz) bit of fun read aloud:

$$\frac{12+144+20+3\sqrt{4}}{7} + (5 \cdot 11) = 9^2 + 0$$

{% highlight R %}
"A dozen, a gross and a score, 
plus three times the square root of four,
all over seven plus five times eleven
is nine squared and not a bit more."
{% endhighlight %}
