This was an email I wrote to a friend after mentioning that I had bought a Sodastream:

In addition to the [Sodastream machine](https://sodastream.com/) itself (which I paid [~$100 at Target](https://www.target.com/c/soda-makers-carbonation/sodastream/-/N-tx3pfZr8p8q)), here's what I bought:

1. Cable (\~$30) I bought this version because it didn't have requirement of closing the tank between uses (unlike some of the ones you find on amazon): [CO2 Sodastream cable](http://news.banggood.com/u/nrd.php?p=woOR8fFW1z_18682102_2675773_-2_1&ems_l=2522012&l=qCCyBP77FFFfkjwppxxmflxv7b9gRwlqg1xmj1CAnjvg1xmjgVjtnAgLuDkgNGCnAwjugQxBnJmjyCnAg%2BrCgCxgL%3AJ_-9gLX-g2jwtg0nyujlnvnwCgJllnBBxArnBgyg._~9e~cfqCvuODCvhmnBrpw4~.ZDCvhBxDAln4nvjABHBZDCvhvnmrDv4WnFxAmnA.c..9eZDCvhljvyjrpw4%24ljvyjrpwhljCnpxAH%24ZDCvhlxwCnwC4FrwwjZBlhBAl4nvjruh%24lrm%24ZBlhnq4%24ynABh~._..%24ZBlhuurm4%24uurm%24ZBlhurm4%24lurwtrm%24ZBlhDrm4%24DBnArm%24&s=1FlhL0tw3yFynuMWN3WiBFT489U)
2. [Dedicated Cylinder Wrench](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R63447F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), nice to have (~$10)
3. Then I went to [AirGas (welding supply)](https://www.airgas.com/) and bought a full 20LB Food Grade CO2 cylinder for $250, I bought their cylinder because there's no guarantee of them refilling it if you don't buy it from them (though you can find cheaper empty cylinders on ebay/etc).

So my initial infrastructure cost is ~$400.

Here's what it looks like:

A refill of the 20LB CO2 Cylinder is $44 dollars.
A sodastream cartridge is .9LBs of CO2 and costs $14-$28 depending on where you buy it and if you're trading in an old cartridge.
I was going through ~2LB of CO2 a month which replaced 4 cases/month of Pellegrino ($15-$20/case).

So monthly ongoing cost is going from $70-90 (Pellegrino) to $30-60 (Sodastream) to ~$5 (AirGas). So, assuming no mechanical failures, I should make up my investment well before the time I need to refill the co2 cylinder.

### Update 1/15/2021:

My first CO2 canister lasted 4 months, and the second lasted 10 months, which makes me think the first one wasn't full when I bought it (or, more likely) I accidentally discharged a bunch of gas when I was trying to connect it for the first time).

In any case, I made up my investment and more. I'm very happy with this set up.
