Welcome to the new home of McW. I'm very happy to be using [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages][pages-gh].

As I get around to recreating some of the pages from the old blog, there will be posts on 
math, algorithms and visualizations demonstrated 
and implemenations in javascript, python, R and whatever else I feel like.

I spent today at the [Microsoft Reactor](http://microsoftreactor.com/) for workshops held by the 
[Open Data Science Conference](http://opendatascicon.com/) on Machine Learning and Python's scikit-learn library.

Much thanks to [Rob Hall](https://twitter.com/hallr) from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/rob-hall/1864) 
and [Lukas Biewald](http://lukasbiewald.com/), CEO of [Crowdflower](http://www.crowdflower.com/) for great workshops. I hope to post some notes on what I learned soon.
