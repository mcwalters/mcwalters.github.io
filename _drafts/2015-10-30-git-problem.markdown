Disclaimer: I love git. I'm pretty sure this stems from learning how to version software on [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) in the late 90s. It was terrible.
When [git was developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)#History), one of its design principles was "take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision."
